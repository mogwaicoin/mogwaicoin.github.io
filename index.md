## WHAT IS MOGWAI COIN?

### An adaptive and cutting-edge Cryptocurrency
Beeing forked of Dash a cryptocurrency of the twenty-first century, we can offer solid features like masternode-technology, near-instant and secure payments, anonymous transaction and last but not least gamification elements for the community.

### An innovative and experimental blockchain project
Driven by the idea of adding community interaction and gamification elements to the blockchain technology.

### A new blockchain experience
The story of mogwai guides you in a new world which has been based on cultural and fictional elements, trying to lower the bar for a wider mainstream adaptation in blockchain projects.

## FEATURES

### Super Fast & Secure
Your time is valuable. InstantSend payments confirm in less than a second. Security you can count on. Transactions are confirmed by miners and masternode servers hosted around the world.

### Anonymous
We use DarkSend, which makes the transactions anonymous. You can trust us completely, and have no need to worry about your transactions. Anonymity allows for peace-of-mind and additional security.

### Dynamic reward System
Concept of creating more interaction between miners and the blockchain

### ASIC Resistant
Everyone can earn coins with mining which is efficient, superior, and fair. ASIC resistance means that there will be no significant speedup when implementing the algorithm in an ASIC when compared to a CPU-based implementation.

### Masternode
Masternodes help keep integrity of the network and enable support for PrivateSend and InstantSend.

### Active Development
The team behind Mogwaicoin is working with great motivation and creativity, trying to bring new features to the community.
